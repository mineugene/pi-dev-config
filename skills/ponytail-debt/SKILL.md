  Harvest existing shortcut comments in the codebase into a debt ledger, so
  deliberate shortcuts and deferrals get tracked instead of rotting into "later
  means never". Use when the user says "ponytail debt", "what did ponytail
  defer", "list the shortcuts", "ponytail ledger", or
  "what did we mark to do later". One-shot report, changes nothing.

Collect existing shortcut comments into one ledger so a deferral can't quietly
become permanent. Do not add branded prefixes to code comments.

## Scan

Grep the repo for shortcut markers, skipping `node_modules`, `.git`, and build
output:

`grep -rnE '(#|//) ?(TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX|debt|shortcut|temporary|naive|global lock)' .`

Each relevant hit is one ledger row.

## Output

One row per marker, grouped by file:

`<file>:<line>, <what was simplified>. ceiling: <the limit named>. upgrade: <the trigger to revisit>.`

Pull the ceiling and trigger straight from the comment when present. Want an
owner per row too? add `git blame -L<line>,<line>`.

Flag the rot risk: any shortcut comment that names no upgrade path or trigger
gets a `no-trigger` tag, those are the ones that silently rot.

End with `<N> markers, <M> with no trigger.` Nothing found: `No deferred shortcut debt. Clean ledger.`

## Boundaries

Reads and reports only, changes nothing. To persist it, ask and it writes the
ledger to a file (e.g. `PONYTAIL-DEBT.md`). One-shot; does not change the
extension-owned Ponytail runtime mode.
